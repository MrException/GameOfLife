# Game of Life

This is just an implementation of the [Conway's Game of
Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) using JavaScript.
Everyone has written this at least once, I figured it was my turn!

## Run it
To see it in action:

* Just open the `index.html` file in your browser

## Tests
I am trying to write this completely using TDD!

To run the tests in your browser:

* Just open the `tests/index.html` file in your browser

To run the tests from the CLI:

* Make sure you have Ruby and Rake installed
* Make sure you have phantomjs installed
* Then simply run `rake test`
